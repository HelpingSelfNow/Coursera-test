	<h3 id="gavin">
		
		Hello my name is Gavin, welcome to my website, this site will be updated 
		weekly (if i'm diligent enough) to incorporate and highlight the skills I 
		have learned on this course. I agree it looks dreary for now yet this is only 
		the end of week one and we are just getting to &quot;CSS&quot; hopefully this 
		site will look better every week and host more functionality as we go along.
